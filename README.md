## The Challenge
Parking near the University of Washington campus is often a frustrating experience for students, faculty, and visitors due to the lack of information, unclear pricing, and limited availability of accessible options. Users currently rely on scattered sources or physical signage, which leads to wasted time, increased costs, and missed opportunities for convenient parking.

## Our Mission
Our goal is not just to help you park, but to help you park better. We aim to make the parking experience as seamless and stress-free as possible for everyone at the University of Washington.

**Problem Statement**: How might we ensure students, faculty, and visitors can easily find **affordable**, **accessible**, and **convenient** parking near the University of Washington campus?

## Features

- **Filter**: Different filters for certain attributes such as pricing, capacity, accessibility
- **Map Markers**: Markers on the map that indicate the location of the parking spot. When clicked a preview will show up
- **Parking Location List**: A list of different parking locations that changes according to the filters. When clicked it will also show the preview according the map marker
- **More Information Button**: When the map marker is clicked a "More Information" button appears that when clicked will navigate to an information page based on the marker
